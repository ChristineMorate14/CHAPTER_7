#Adding Animation to an App

In this chapter, "Adding Animation to an app" I learned how to add animations to the app to improve the UX. I implemented AnimatedContainer to animate the width of a Container widget with a beautiful spring effect by using Curves.elasticOut. Adding the AnimatedCrossFade widget to cross-fade between two children widgets. The color is animated from amber to green while at the same time the widget increased or decreased in width and height. To fade a widget in, out, or partially, you added the AnimatedOpacity widget. The AnimatedOpacity widget uses the opacity property passed over a period of time (Duration) to fade the widget. The AnimationController class allows the creation of custom animations. I learned to use multiple AnimationControllers with different durations. Using two Animation classes to control the floating upward or downward and the inflation and deflation of the balloon at the same time. The animation is created by using Tween with begin and end values. Also using different CurvedAnimation class for a nonlinear effect like Curves.fastOutSlowIn to float upward or downward and Curves.elasticInOut to inflate or deflate the balloon. Lastly, using one AnimationController class with multiple Animation classes to create staggered animations, which give a similar effect. 
The AnimatedCrossFade constructor takes a duration argument, and use the Duration class to specify 500 milliseconds. The sizeCurve argument gives the animation between the two childrenâ€™s size a spring effect by using Curves.bounceOut. The crossFadeState argument sets the child widget to be shown once the animation is completed. By using the _crossFadeStateShowFirst variable, the correct crossFadeState child is displayed. The firstChild and secondChild arguments hold the two widgets to animate.
